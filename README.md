- Enable the module.

### Using Composer
Since this module isn't published as a package to a repository, using composer to install the module necessitates modifying the root composer.json file for the site.

Option 1 is to add the module as a package by adding an entry to `repositories:[]` (see below) and running `composer require drupal/smithsonian_appliance`:
```
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "https://packages.drupal.org/8"
        },
        {
            "type": "package",
            "package": {
                "name": "drupal/smithsonian_appliance",
                "version": "1.0.0",
                "type": "drupal-custom-module",
                "source": {
                    "url": "https://github.com/couloir007/smithsonian_appliance.git",
                    "type": "git",
                    "reference": "master"
                }
            }
        }
    ],
```

Option 2 is to install by adding the location of the module as an additional repository and downloading the module to that location, e.g. 2nd entry here:

```
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "https://packages.drupal.org/8"
        },
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "/path/to/modulefiles/smithsonian_appliance"
        }
    ],
```
